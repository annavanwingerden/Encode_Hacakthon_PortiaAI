He describes how particles move from one place to another with a certain probability, which is determined by a simple rule involving a quantity called the action. This action is related to the mass of the particle, the time, and the distance. By calculating these probabilities, one can determine the likelihood of a particle, such as an electron, moving from one point to another in a given space. This formulation underlies much of quantum mechanics, providing a foundational understanding of particle behavior.",
