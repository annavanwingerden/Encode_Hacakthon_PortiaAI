                "value": "As of 2025, quantum computers have made significant strides in speed and computational power, leveraging the principles of superposition and entanglement to perform complex calculations much faster than classical computers. Quantum computers excel in tasks such as factoring large numbers, optimizing complex systems, and simulating quantum physics, which are infeasible for classical systems due to their exponential complexity. The performance of quantum computers is often measured in terms of qubits, with leading systems now operating with hundreds of qubits, allowing them to solve specific problems exponentially faster than the best classical supercomputers. Despite challenges such as error rates and decoherence, advancements in quantum error correction and qubit coherence times continue to enhance their reliability and scalability. The primary advantage of quantum computers lies in their ability to process vast amounts of data simultaneously, offering transformative potential in fields like cryptography, materials science, and artificial intelligence.",
