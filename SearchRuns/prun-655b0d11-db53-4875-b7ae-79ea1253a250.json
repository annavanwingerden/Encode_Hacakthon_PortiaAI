                "value": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a6us8kaq0g : What is cloud computing? So that is the topic \nof this video. Now you may have heard of people   talking about the cloud, such as cloud computing \nor cloud storage, but you probably weren't sure   exactly what it was. Well, the term cloud computing \nrefers to data and applications being stored and   run on the cloud rather than being stored and run \non your local computer or on any equipment that   you own. Then this data and the applications which \nare on the cloud are accessed through the internet   So the workload is no longer on your computer or \non any equipment that you own, it's on the cloud.   So what is the cloud?  Now to put it simple, the \ncloud is just a big building that's filled   with computers.  To be specific, it's a big building \nfilled with servers and servers are just computers   that provide services on behalf of clients.  Now \nthese buildings are very large, and well they have   to be, because when you take a look inside, it's a \ngiant data center that contains servers as far as   the eye can see.  And these servers perform numerous \ntasks, such as running applications, storing data,   data processing, web hosting, and so on.  And they \nare also all networked together and they can be   accessed on the internet.  So what is the purpose of \na cloud?  Well, the companies that own these clouds   are called cloud providers and their purpose is to \nsell their computers as a service.  Now a service is   just something that you pay someone to do for you \nrather than doing the job yourself.  So if a person   or a company wanted to hire another company \nto do part or all of their computing workload,   they would outsource it to a third party.  In\nother words, they would use cloud computing   So back in the old days before cloud computing and \nas an example we'll use email.  So at your home or   office if you wanted to use email you would have \nyour own physical email server.  So you would have   a server, an operating system, and email software \nsuch as Microsoft exchange.  And then after some   configuration , you would be able to use email. \nBut the problem is, is that if anything goes   wrong with the server, such as a hardware failure \nor a software problem , or if the operating system   crashed, then you would be responsible for fixing \nthe problem, not to mention any maintenance that is   needed to keep the server up and running. However \nyou do have the option of eliminating all the   hassle and upkeep of your own email server and \nhave another company host all of your email on   their servers in the cloud for you, such as gmail \nhotmail and a bunch of others.  But email is just   one example of cloud computing.  There are also \nother services such as productivity software,   web servers, databases, and even Youtube.   So yes \nyou as an individual can use Youtube as a cloud   So if you're a video creator and instead \nof building and maintaining your own video   server and software and the extreme high cost of \ninternet bandwidth that you would need for people   to watch your videos from your server, you can \nbypass that and you can just upload your videos   to Youtube and let Youtube handle everything for \nyou.  But instead of directly paying youtube like a   regular cloud provider, Youtube will get a share of \nthe ad revenue generated by your videos.  So another   question is, why would an individual or a company \nuse cloud computing?  Well as I just mentioned a   major reason is cost.  With cloud computing a person \nor company eliminates a lot of the expense of   buying their own hardware and software, along \nwith the building maintenance and electricity   it takes to run their own data center.  So it would \nbe more cost efficient to use a cloud instead.   And another reason is reliability.  Because when you \nhire a cloud, the cloud provider is responsible for   all of the data backup and disaster recovery.  And \nif one of its data centers goes down, they will   also have several redundant sites as a backup \nwhich will ensure that there is no downtime.  And  another reason is scalability.  Cloud providers will \noffer a 'pay as you go' method where you can pay for   only what you need.  So whether you need to rent \na few computers or a lot, it doesn't matter.  So if   you only want to rent a small amount of computers \nto start out, you can do that.  But as your business   expands, you have the option of instantly \nrenting more computers to suit your needs   And if you don't need to rent as many computers, \nyou can instantly scale back to renting only a few   So who are the cloud providers today?  Well \nthe major cloud providers today are Amazon   Web Services or (AWS).   Microsoft Azure,  Google Cloud Platform, Alibaba, and IBM.  With Amazon Web Services   being the biggest of them all - taking about a third \nof the cloud market share.  In fact one of AWS'  biggest customers is Netflix.  Netflix uses Amazon Web Services for nearly all of its computer and   storage needs including databases, analytics ,video \ntranscoding, and so on.  So instead of building its   own data center and spending hundreds of millions \nof dollars on hosting its own data, Netflix chose   to outsource it to a cloud provider which is \nAmazon.  So a major advantage that Netflix has   of using a cloud is that they don't have to worry \nabout downtime, security, data backup, or the high   cost of building and maintaining their own data \ncenter.  They can just pay Amazon to do it for them   So this takes a tremendous burden off of Netflix \nwhich allows them to focus on other things   pertaining to their business.  Now there are \nthree different types of cloud computing. There's   infrastructure as a service or (IaaS).  Platform as a \nservice or (PaaS) and Software as a service or (SaaS).  And these three vary in control and flexibility. \nSo it's up to the user to decide what suits their   needs.  So the first one is infrastructure as a \nservice.  Now this type is basically where you're   going to let the cloud provider manage a portion \nof your business which is going to be the hardware   portion.  The cloud provider will manage the servers, \nstorage, virtualization, and the networking portion.   You on the other hand will still have control over \nthe software portion.  Such as the applications, data,   operating system, middleware, and runtime.  Some \nexamples of infrastructure as a service that   the common person would use would be online data \nbackup services, such as iDrive and Carbonite that   provide cloud storage.  And the next one is called \nplatform as a service.  Now (PaaS) like (IaaS) allows   the cloud provider to manage a portion of your \nbusiness.  But the cloud provider has more control.   In a (PaaS) the cloud provider not only manages the \nhardware such as servers, storage, and networking, but   it also manages the operating system, middleware, \nand runtime.  You on the other hand are only   responsible for the applications and the data.\nAnd finally there's software as a service or (SaaS)   Now this is probably the most common cloud \nservice by far.  In this type, all the applications   are hosted by the cloud provider.  There is no \nsoftware to install on your computer and no   hardware to manage.  You just simply access and \nrun the application from your computer when you   connect to the cloud service through the internet. \nSo the cloud provider manages all the hardware,   software, networking, operating system, and storage. \nA good example of (SaaS) is something that I use   all the time, which is Google Docs.  Google \nDocs is a free online office suite that is   accessed using a web browser.  There is no \nadditional software that needs to be installed   on your computer to use Google Docs.  Everything \nis accessed and managed from your web browser.  So this concludes the video on cloud computing. \nPlease subscribe and thank you for watching.",
