In a study published in the journal Animal Behavior, scientists observed bumblebees engaging in play by rolling wooden balls, a behavior akin to how humans and dogs play. This discovery marks the first time insects have been seen interacting with inanimate objects purely for enjoyment, indicating a level of sophistication in their minds. The experiments showed that younger bees played more frequently than older ones, and adult males engaged in this playful activity longer than females of the same age. These findings challenge the traditional view of insects as mere workhorses of nature, highlighting their potential for complex behaviors.
