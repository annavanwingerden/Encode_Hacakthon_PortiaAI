which is Google's openweight model that was just released this past week it outperformed GPT 4 omon and it was a super lightweight model with only 27 billion parameters for its model size but now we have another new model that's even better than Gemma 3 and it's even smaller allow me to introduce mistol small 3.1 mistol is finally back again with the new state-of-the-art model that is under the Pachi 2.0 license that also is multimodal and it is multilingual it's roughly in the same ballpark as Gemma 327b but slightly better and it beats gp4 Omni mini and Claw 3.5 Hau completely now mistol small 3.1 is a 24 billion parameter model that runs on a single RTX 4090 or a mac o s which is approximately 32 GB of RAM this could be an ideal local chatot that can be something that you can access right now and it has 128k context window with a blazing fast 150 tokens per second in regards to its speed it can now process a lot more in terms of understanding visual inputs as well as long documents which is further expanding its range of application this mistol 3.1 model was actually built on its predecessor cessor the mistal small 3 Model but with this new model it is a bit more versatile for tasks such as programming math reasoning you have dialogue long document understanding visual understanding summarization and low latency application before we get started I just want to mention that you should definitely go ahead and subscribe to the world of AI newsletter I'm constantly posting different newsletters on a weekly basis so this is where you can easily get upto-date knowledge about what is happening in the AI space so definitely go ahead and subscribe as this is completely for free now in regards to its performance it is kind of impressive to see that such a lightweight model is able to outperform many of these big proprietary models like gbt 4 Omni mini and Cloud 3.5 Sonic or sorry Haiku and in this case we can see that it leads in general knowledge you have it so that it could demonstrate strong reasoning and problem solving capabilities and with multimodal capabilities it is surprisingly better than GPT for omony and with multilingual support it's able to support I believe 21 plus languages which is really nice it has long context Mastery pre-trained performance with MML u gpq a and so many other benchmarks so overall this is a great all-rounded model and if you're looking for high quality with a lightweight solution that is open source this is definitely the best option that's available at the moment now if you're looking to get started you can easily use your chat bot called Le platform and this is essentially mol's chatbot where you can easily work with the small 3.1 model you can also install this locally through the hugging face model card and then if you wanted to access it off of Google Cloud's vertex AI you can easily do so open it in your notebook and then you can actually fine-tune it via uh Google Cloud now you also have the ability to access this off of a router like open router now if you're looking to install this with AMA unfortunately you cannot do it at the moment cuz it's not uploaded yet but once they do release the model card you can easily access it through the model list over here which will be shown at the top you can simply click on that model card this is just an example don't go ahead and install Gemma 3 but you can then copy the mistal small 3.1 model card have Ama opened up and have it make sure it's running in the back end and then open up your command prompt simply paste in the model card uh command to install it and then you can open it up within a web UI to start interacting with the small 3.1 model now for the next portion of the video we're going to be assessing the mistro small 3.1 on a bunch of these different prompts from different categories from programming to creating different types of code solving mathematical equations and so much more this is to get a better idea of how well this model is in different categories so let's first start off by having it build out a web page using HTML and then have users uh log their monthly expenses and income we're trying to see how well this model is in terms of creating uh various sorts of front ends and we're going to see how old this model is in terms of programming based off the prompt that we have so let's go over to open router and send in this prompt so I actually had to go back and generate this once again cuz I had Auto router on so I actually used the Deep seek R1 with this model but afterwards I was able to generate this simple web page or web app for the monthly budget tracker which looks pretty nice and this is actually more sleeker than what I got from Jemma 3 and this is where I'm able to add the transaction the income type uh expense or an income and then you can add a salary and then you can add the amount and then the description and then you can track your recent transactions now there's a chart that was supposed to be generated but it doesn't look like it's working right now so I would need to go back and have it generate that but essentially this is the basic app that I had requested and it did get the job done so let's go over and give this a pass I was really surprised to see the code generation for this model so really impressed by that next up since this model is a multimodal model we're going to be assessing this image over here we're sending it in and asking it to detect the red car we're trying to see how many red cars are in the image and there's actually only one so let's see how many cars it actually ends up detecting and you can see it was pretty quick it was able to detect one red car so let's go over and actually provide something a bit more intricate here's a different prompt we're going to have it describe this image image over here and since this model is pretty quick it'll respond with a pretty nice response within a couple seconds which you see over here it talks about the image featuring a dock standing in a forested area during winter which is definitely correct you can see there's snow on the floor and it's in a forest and then it also is talking about describing the dog itself mediumsized breed with brown and white coat it's looking directly at the camera so it does a pretty good job in describing the scene so I'm kind of impressed by that does a pretty great job for that so let's go over and give this a pass next up we're going to have it create an SVG representation of a butterfly now this is a prompt that most models tend to fail at but let's see if this model is capable of generating a symmetrical butterfly with simple styling as well as Wings it's assessing how well the model is in generating SVG code so I've copied the code and let's go over to this online SVG viewer to see what it generated and it generated a box it didn't even generate the actual butterfly and I don't know why it didn't even this was actually the worst generation I've ever gotten for a butterfly in SVG let me go back and reprompt this all right so I got another generation from open router I copied it and it does not look good at all this does not look like a butterfly and unfortunately I'm giving this the worst generation of an SG representation of a butterfly I've never seen any model outut something like this so so unfortunately this is a fail even Gemma 3 failed at this so it's nothing too bad but it's kind of disappointing next up we're having it solve this equation over here for solving for x and it's a quadratic formula and we're trying to see how well this model is in terms of solving these different types of equations using quadratic formulas so the answer is X providing uh three as well as one and this is definitely deemed a pass so in terms of math it does a solid job it's a basic question but we'll be providing more difficult questions later on next up we have a logical reasoning word problem this is where I'm saying a farmer has 10 cows five goats and two chickens each cow gives 10 lers of milk daily each goat gives three liters and the chickens do not produce milk how much milk does the farmer collect in a week now this is a assessment that is going to have the model processed numerical information the ability to multiply for real world scenarios and I'm trying to see if it's able to break it down which I do see over here and overall the answer is 85 L of milk in a week which is definitely deemed a pass it breaks it down into four different categories from daily milk production from cows goats the total production and the weekly milk production so this is definitely deemed a pass the next prompt I'm trying to have it break it down in three different segments I wanted to focus on this bugged python function and it is supposed to return a new list of containing only the even numbers from the original list but it has a bug so I'm trying to have it identify and it does provide me the fixed code where it removes the else condition we see within the original code it also was able to ensure the entire list is processed before returning and I wanted to essentially provide the example structured output which it did it focused on the explanation and overall it had corrected the debugged or the bugged code and provided me a solution so this is definitely deemed a pass and this is actually a prompt that is pretty easy to solve but it's a little difficult in terms of having it being resolved in most cases with other smaller based models now this isn't something too crazy but I'm asking it if you put a bowl of water in freezing temperatures what will happen and I'm telling it to uh expand on this further it's a category of physics in science and I'm assessing the model's understanding of phase changes in water and basic temperature uh it gets the temperature St stabilization correct it focuses on the Concepts like expansion cooling down formation of ice and it does get you the correct answer with a step-by-step process of why it happens and practical implications so this is definitely deemed a pass and lastly we're going to ask it to read the following passage and then answer a question about it without reading Alice went to the market bought three apples two bananas and five oranges she met her friend Sarah who bought a loaf of bread and a bottle of milk they went to the park enjoyed their purchases the question is how many oranges did Alice buy this is actually a prompt that is kind of difficult for a lot of models because it is focusing on comprehension as well as memory and it tests the model's ability to retain information after reading this answer or the question quite quickly and it did provide me the correct answer which was five oranges so this is definitely deemed a pass now if I have to compare this with the Jamma 3 results it got the exact same performance it got the same question wrong as Gemma 3 but it provided a better answer in all these other cases so it's definitely a great all-rounded model it's even lighter than the Gemma 3 model and it's something that you can easily get started with today if you like this video and would love to support the channel you can consider donating to my Channel Through the super thanks option below or you can consider joining our private Discord where you can access multiple subscriptions to different AI tools for free on monthly basis plus daily AI news and exclusive content plus a lot more overall I'm just happy to see more open- Source models beating proprietary models which is just great to see and we're starting to see faster models being released which this is actually faster than the Gemma 3 as well as the gbd4 Omni mini and in terms of Benchmark performance it does a great job in almost every category so this is a great all-rounded model while being multimodal and multilingual so I definitely recommend that you try
