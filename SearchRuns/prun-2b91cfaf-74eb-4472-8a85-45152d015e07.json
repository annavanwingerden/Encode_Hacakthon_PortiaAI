And how can we organize society\nto meet people's needs? These questions challenged\nan entire nation during the upheaval\nof the French Revolution. By the end of the 18th century, Europe had undergone a profound\nintellectual and cultural shift known as the Enlightenment. Philosophers and artists promoted\nreason and human freedom over tradition and religion. The rise of a middle class\nand printed materials encouraged political awareness, and the American Revolution had turned\na former English colony into an independent republic. Yet France, one of the largest and richest\ncountries in Europe was still governed by an ancient regime\nof three rigid social classes called Estates. The monarch King Louis XVI\nbased his authority on divine right and granted special privileges\nto the First and Second Estates, the Catholic clergy, and the nobles. The Third Estate, middle class merchants\nand craftsmen, as well as over 20 million peasants,\nhad far less power and they were the only ones\nwho paid taxes, not just to the king,\nbut to the other Estates as well. In bad harvest years, taxation could leave peasants\nwith almost nothing while the king and nobles lived lavishly\non their extracted wealth. But as France sank into debt due to\nits support of the American Revolution and its long-running war with England, change was needed. King Louis appointed\nfinance minister Jacques Necker, who pushed for tax reforms and won public support by openly\npublishing the government's finances. But the king's advisors\nstrongly opposed these initiatives. Desperate for a solution, the king called\na meeting of the Estates-General, an assembly of representatives\nfrom the Three Estates, for the first time in 175 years. Although the Third Estate represented\n98% of the French population, its vote was equal to each\nof the other Estates. And unsurprisingly, both of the upper\nclasses favored keeping their privileges. Realizing they couldn't\nget fair representation, the Third Estate broke off, declared themselves\nthe National Assembly, and pledged to draft a new constitution\nwith or without the other Estates. King Louis ordered the First\nand Second Estates to meet with the National Assembly, but he also dismissed Necker,\nhis popular finance minister. In response, thousands\nof outraged Parisians joined with sympathetic soldiers\nto storm the Bastille prison, a symbol of royal power\nand a large storehouse of weapons. The Revolution had begun. As rebellion spread\nthroughout the country, the feudal system was abolished. The Assembly's Declaration\nof the Rights of Man and Citizen proclaimed a radical idea for the time -- that individual rights and freedoms\nwere fundamental to human nature and government existed\nonly to protect them. Their privileges gone,\nmany nobles fled abroad, begging foreign rulers to invade France\nand restore order. And while Louis remained as the figurehead\nof the constitutional monarchy, he feared for his future. In 1791, he tried to flee the country\nbut was caught. The attempted escape shattered\npeople's faith in the king. The royal family was arrested\nand the king charged with treason. After a trial, the once-revered king\nwas publicly beheaded, signaling the end of one thousand\nyears of monarchy and finalizing the September 21st\ndeclaration of the first French republic, governed by the motto\n\"liberté, égalité, fraternité.\" Nine months later, Queen Marie Antoinette, a foreigner long-mocked\nas \"Madame Déficit\" for her extravagant reputation, was executed as well. But the Revolution would not end there. Some leaders, not content\nwith just changing the government, sought to completely transform\nFrench society -- its religion,\nits street names, even its calendar. As multiple factions formed, the extremist Jacobins\nlead by Maximilien Robespierre launched a Reign of Terror to suppress the slightest dissent, executing over 20,000 people before the Jacobin's own downfall. Meanwhile, France found itself\nat war with neighboring monarchs seeking to strangle the Revolution\nbefore it spread. Amidst the chaos, a general named\nNapoleon Bonaparte took charge, becoming Emperor as he claimed to defend\nthe Revolution's democratic values. All in all, the Revolution\nsaw three constitutions and five governments within ten years, followed by decades\nalternating between monarchy and revolt before the next Republic formed in 1871. And while we celebrate\nthe French Revolution's ideals, we still struggle with many\nof the same basic questions raised over two centuries ago.",
