Coined by Arthur Samuel in 1959, machine learning involves acquiring and cleaning data, feature engineering, and separating data into training and testing sets. Algorithms, ranging from simple models like linear regression to complex ones like convolutional neural networks, learn by minimizing error functions. Python is the preferred language for data scientists, with R and Julia also popular. The end result is a model that can be deployed in real-world applications.
