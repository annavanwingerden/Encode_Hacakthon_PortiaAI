They discuss the challenges faced in matching the wig to their natural hair color, as the wig was initially too bright. Additionally, they humorously recount their struggle with a small wig cap that kept slipping off due to their larger head size. Despite not being experienced with wigs, they managed to style it by separating and teasing the hair, and applying makeup to improve the overall look. The video concludes with a positive note, encouraging viewers not to underestimate affordable wigs available on Amazon, as they can still achieve a cute and satisfactory appearance.",
