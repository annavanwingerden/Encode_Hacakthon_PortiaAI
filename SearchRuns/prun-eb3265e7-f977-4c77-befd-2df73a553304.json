                "value": "Glass is a unique material characterized by its transparent or translucent nature and is classified as a non-crystalline or amorphous substance, often described as a supercooled liquid due to its solid-like appearance resulting from increased viscosity upon rapid cooling. The manufacturing process of glass involves three main steps: the fusion of raw materials, working with the molten mass, and annealing. The raw materials, including soda ash (Na2CO3), limestone (CaCO3), and sand (SiO2), are mixed with cullet to lower the melting temperature, then heated to 1,000°C to form liquid glass. Impurities are removed, and salts may be added for color. The molten glass is shaped in molds and undergoes annealing, a process of controlled cooling that strengthens the glass. Various types of glass, such as soda glass, Pyrex, quartz, flint, and borosilicate, each have distinct properties and uses, ranging from window panes and laboratory glassware to optical instruments and baking dishes.",
