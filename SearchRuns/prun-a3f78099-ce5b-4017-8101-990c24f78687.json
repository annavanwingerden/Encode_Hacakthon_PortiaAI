market graph for a product ok now we do not care what the product is but what we're we can we can pretend or imagine all different kinds of products it can be a good what we call a physical good it for example it can be a phone ok a mobile phone it can also be a car you know the supply of cars and the demand for cars it can be food at a restaurant this could be the supply of chick-fil-a and the demand for chick-fil-a it can also be a service for example it could be a service for your phone phone service like for Verizon or AT&T ok it's the supply of phone service and the demand for phone service so it doesn't really matter what the product is most products almost all products follow this basic format of a downward sloping demand curve and an upward sloping supply curve now I want you to note that what I have drawn here is not as specific as what we saw in the previous lesson where I had a grid where you can actually count out the quantity and count out the price and what I want you to know is where we're moving now is where we're going to discuss these concepts more abstractly so we're gonna do let a fewer specifics and and and be a lot more general and more abstract we no longer really care about what the specific price is equilibrium prices or what the specific equilibrium quantity is what we're really concerned with is when there's a change in the market and there will be changes in the market in fact the word dynamic implies the idea that something is changing okay that when there is a change in the market we don't care what the new equilibrium price is and there will be a new equilibrium price and we don't care what the new equilibrium quantity is well the only thing we really care is whether the equilibrium price goes up or down or whether the equilibrium quantity goes up or down we don't care what the actual value is in this principles of macroeconomics class we are just simply learning the basics of supply and demand and the dynamics of what happens to demand and supply and what happens to equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity okay so we're gonna talk about change we're gonna talk what is change all right think about a number let's let's just think about any number like the number seven okay let's just consider the number seven right and let's consider that it is on a number line and we can make it a horizontal number line or we can make it a vertical number line if we want to we'll put the number seven on there so I don't know if you're a vertical number line person or a horizontal number line person now generally speaking to the right on a horizontal number line to the right all the numbers are larger and to the left all the numbers are smaller that's just the way that we do things in our culture okay on a vertical number line numbers that are larger are up and all the numbers that are smaller are down right okay so if we are changing let's say let's attach the number seven to something let's say seven is the number of dollars in your pocket let's say that you have seven dollars in your pocket if that were to change to where you don't have seven dollars in your pocket anymore you have a different amount of money in your pocket there are only two possible changes that happen to that number seven the number seven can either increase by becoming a larger number like eight or the number can decrease by becoming a smaller number like six so the number seven can only change whatever it's representing like price or quantity the there's only two ways that it can change it can either increase by becoming a larger number or it can decrease by becoming a smaller number now there is a third option and that's it could stay the same it could just not change at all so any number like price or quantity only has three possible states it's either gonna stay the same or it's gonna increase or it's gonna decrease and we can say the same thing if it's on a vertical number line that if the number seven were to become larger like the number eight that we would call an increase and I represent that by using an upward arrow but if the number seven were to change and go down to the number six we would call that a decrease and we would use a downward arrow and so when I'm explaining things in economics especially when I'm talking about market dynamics I often use up arrows to represent the word increase and I often use down arrows to represent the word decrease okay and so what we're gonna do here is we're gonna try there's there's basically we have four things represented on this graph I'm going to point to them four things we have supply we have demand we have price and we have quantity and all four of these things are being represented by something numeric something with numbers price is an absolute number like $27 quantity is an absolute number like a hundred and fourteen units but supply and demand their diagonal lines and so they're represented by something more complicated like a function okay but they still have numbers in there and the numbers that are a part of that function can change so ultimately in market dynamics we're going to be concerned with four kinds of changes we're going to be concerned with changes in demand changes in supply changes in equilibrium price and changes in equilibrium quantity now when I refer to a change in demand demand can only change in one of two ways it can either increase or decrease so if I'm referring to an increase in demand I'm going to do an upward arrow with a D if I'm referring to a decrease in demand I'm going to do a downward arrow with a D and so this right here that's an increase and a downward arrow that is a decrease now for changes in supply I will use an upward arrow with an S to represent an increase in supply and I will use a downward arrow with an S to represent a decrease in supply similarly for changes in equilibrium price I will use an upward arrow with a P sub e to represent an increase in equilibrium price and I'll use a downward arrow with a P sub e to represent a decrease in equilibrium price and then for equilibrium quantity I will use again an upward arrow to represent so when I say upward arrow equilibrium quantity I mean that equilibrium quantity is becoming larger so if equilibrium quantity was a hundred and now it's a hundred and twenty that was an increase in equilibrium quantity and then for a decrease in equilibrium quantity I will use a downward arrow with a q sub e now on the graph on the market graph it's important to understand that equilibrium quantity is represent is represented on the horizontal axis right so when there is a an increase in equilibrium quantity that means that instead of being here the little where where it is on the horizontal axis is going to move to the right that is an increase so this would be an increase in equilibrium quantity and if this moves this direction to where it's over here if equilibrium quantity so let's say that this point this intersection this equilibrium point what if it was over here instead if it was over here instead then we would come down here and this is where equilibrium quantity would be and that would be a it's moving to the left and a leftward movement of equilibrium quantity we would say is a decrease or a downward arrow in equilibrium quantity so when this when equilibrium when the equal equilibrium point moves this direction in the graph that would be an increase in equilibrium quantity when it moves this direction that would be a decrease in equilibrium quantity same thing with equilibrium price except that it's vertical so if equilibrium price if this equilibrium point is now up here that's an increase and we would say up arrow P sub e increase in equilibrium price and if the equilibrium point wound up being down here somewhere or over here so anywhere below this anywhere down here we would have a decrease equilibrium price would go down and we would say down arrow piece of e that's a decrease in equilibrium price okay so what we said in a previous lesson is this is that the supply and demand curve they can shift and and when the supply or the demand curve shift on the market graph they only go left and right they never go up and down now that should already be in your notes okay and what we said is that a left shift this direction is that would be a decrease so a decrease in demand or a decrease in supply that would be represented on the graph by a left shift okay a left shift of the entire curve meaning that the whole curve would move from here over to here or this whole curve would move from here over to here okay but an increase in demand or an increase in supply are represented by a right shift and in that sense the whole curve would move to the right or this whole curve would move to the right okay right shift is considered to be an increase in supply or an increase in demand okay do you remember at the very beginning of the class we talked about ceteris paribus the ceteris paribus assumption and what we said was this is that this ceteris paribus is where we hold everything unchanged except for one thing we're only going to change one thing at a time and then see how that changes other things what are the effects of making just a single change and so here's what I want to show you the first thing I want to say is that that these changes down here changes in equilibrium price and changes in equilibrium quantity those are results those aren't things that we're going to change okay those are the results of change they are not we're not making those things happen that's what's happening as a result of something changing but change in demand and change in supply those are the things that we're going to change okay we will change these okay so we're going to we are going to cause them to change so we're gonna cut this is the cause and this down here is the effect so we have because and the effect these are the results of the change so here's the kinds of questions I'm going to ask I'm going to say when there is an increase in demand and what then will happen to equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity what will be the resulting change in equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity when there is an increase in demand and so what we're now going to do is one thing at a time we're gonna look at these four changes there's four possible changes because there's two things that we're changing we're changing demand and we're changing supply and when we change them they can only either increase or decrease so two things can change in two ways so that's four possible changes in any market and we're gonna look one at a time at all four of those changes and how each one of those four changes is going to affect the results of equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity and when each one of when supply or demand change in a market we call that a dynamic market the market is dynamic the supply curve is moving fluctuating the demand curve is moving it is fluctuating and when the supply curve fluctuates and when the demand curve fluctuates it results in fluctuations in price and quantity and that's what we're gonna see right now all right so what I've done here is I've set up in two different ways over here we're going to create a chart and over here we're going to look at the graphs so what we're gonna do is we're gonna work from here take our information from the graph and we're gonna put it over here in the chart so that you can summarize the information about what happens when there is an increase or a decrease in demand or supply okay and since there's four possible changes what I thought that we could do is we could we would have a separate graph for each one of the changes so let's go ahead and start up here but now note that all four of these graphs are the starting position of the market let's say that we have a market that it that hasn't changed in just a little while that the supply and the demand curve are just sort of sitting there demanders this is how they feel suppliers this is their cost structure and because of the cost structure of the suppliers and the attitudes of the demanders the this is the equilibrium price at the intersection and this is the equilibrium quantity from the intersection and it's the same in all four of these cases now what we're going to do is we're gonna make a different change in each one of these in this graph we're gonna do an increase in demand in this graph we're gonna do an increase in supply in this graph we're gonna do a decrease in demand and in this graph we're gonna do a decrease in supply now in in the next lesson I'm gonna explain to you why these things change why does the demand curve change why does the supply curve change but for now I don't want I don't want to talk about that let's just assume that something is happening that it's causing the demand curve or the supply curve to change okay now when the curve or when demand changes the way it's gonna look is as a shift in the curve and we talked about that in a previous lesson and what we said just a little while ago is that when there is an increase in demand demand increasing an increase means a rightward movement an increase is going to the right because remember we said that these curves they don't go up and down they go left and right okay so an increase mathematically means to the right all the larger numbers are to the right and all the smaller numbers are to the left so an increase in demand which I'm going to represent as an upward arrow with a an upward arrow with a D so an increase in demand and then what I often do is I put these sideways arrows my sideways arrows basically means leads to okay so or causes so an increase in demand is going to cause like a domino effect a chain reaction an increase in demand causes a rightward shift of the demand curve so to the right I'm going to put a couple rightward arrows there's a right arrow there's another right arrow pointing to the right indicating an increase and this curve is going to sort of move along those arrows and move over to the right and so now we're gonna have a new demand curve the demand curve is shifting over to the right and I'm gonna represent that by the letter D with a little apostrophe on it and we call that D Prime and so if there is an increase in demand that's gonna be represented on a market graph as a rightward shift of the demand curve over to D Prime and now look what happened let's ignore this intersection here this intersection is going away this is no longer the equilibrium the new equilibrium is where the old supply curve which didn't move ceteris paribus we're only moving one thing at a time the new demand curve is over here and look this point right here that's the new intersection of supply and demand this one is gone market forces are now going to get involved see now the price is too low and what's gonna happen here if we go if we then take this equilibrium point and go over here to the left that's gonna be our new equilibrium remember market forces say if the price is too low here if demand has increased that's gonna put upward force on the price and when the price goes up so we're gonna have PE prime that's the new equilibrium and we can go vertically down here to the quantity axis and that is our new equilibrium quantity will put Queen Q to the QE Prime and look what happened to equilibrium quantity is it it also increased and here's what I'm trying to show you here is the result is that when demand increases that results in a right shift a right D demand curve shift okay so a rightward shift of the demand curve and then it's going to result in two things first of all it's going to result in an increase in equilibrium price so increase in P sub e which we could represent as up arrow an up arrow P sub e right it's also going to result in an increase in equilibrium quantity so increase in Q sub e and in parentheses we'll say that that's an up arrow with a q sub e so here's what I'm saying is that when there's an increase in demand in any market there will subsequently be an increase in equilibrium price and an increase in equilibrium quantity okay so let's think about what does this mean let's get away from the math and the graph so let's think about this let's say that there's a particular pair of shoes that becomes more popular I brought this up previously let's say that there was an athlete that won a big event at the Olympics and now all of a sudden everybody wants the same shoes that that athlete was wearing well the demand for that shoe is going to increase more people are going to be more willing and more able to buy those shoes mostly willing they'll be more willing to buy the shoes when those people are more willing to buy those shoes you know what's gonna happen to that shoe the price is gonna go up but people are still gonna buy more of it even though the price goes up people are gonna buy more why are they buying more even though the price went up you're gonna say professor Ryan you said that when the price goes up people are gonna buy less yes that's ceteris paribus that's with no change in demand but now something has caused people to want that product more they are more willing than they used to be so their demand changed when the demand changes in an increased direction the net result according to this graph is that the price will go up and there will be more produced and more sold doesn't that make sense when something's more popular when something becomes more popular they're willing to it always winds up going up in price and people wind up buying more and more of it that's weird yes that's because the demand curve shifted to the right okay all right that's an increase in demand well now let's do a decrease in demand what would happen if demand decreased what if people wanted less of something they were less willing or less able to buy it let's say that they were less able to let's say people have less money something happens and people just have less money than they used to have okay just maybe for a little a little while all of a sudden people can't buy all the same things they were buying before okay let's say that they were able to buy I don't know let's think of something good they were able to go out to eat a lot but now that they have less money they can't go out to eat a lot okay so let's say that this is the supply and the demand for eating out at restaurants okay well people are going to eat out at restaurants less there's going to be a decrease in demand well a decrease remember we said it only either moves right or left decrease for something to become smaller is indicated by a leftward movement and so a decrease in demand so put downward arrow with a D is going to lead to a left demand curve shift so a leftward shift of the demand curve and a leftward shift so we're going to put some left arrows in here go ahead and put a left arrow a left arrow so now that demand curve is going to move over to the left so I'm going to draw a demand curve over to the left that's our new demand curve which we're gonna call D Prime that's our new demand curve and now look at the new intersection point here's the equilibrium point the equilibrium point used to be up here but now the equilibrium point is down here and if we draw a little dashed line over here and we draw a little dashed line down here to the quantity we can see that the new equilibrium price which we'll call equal of PE prime + QE prime that is the new equilibrium price in the new equilibrium quantity and you can see here now that there is a dots indicating what happened to the price the price went from up here down to here and the quantity went from here over to here backwards to the left so that's a decrease in equilibrium quantity and a decrease in equilibrium price so here's what we're gonna say look when there's a decrease in demand not only will there be a leftward shift of the demand curve but we will ultimately the result will be that there will be a decrease in equilibrium price which we'll put as a downward arrow with a piece of e there will also be a decrease in equilibrium quantity so we'll put downward arrow with a Q sub E now if you're catching on to this then these last two supply they're going to be a piece of cake well you have to be good at doing is you have to be good at producing one of these starting graphs and then deciding for yourself what's moving is the demand curve moving or is the supply curve moving and so now we're going to work on an increase in supply so let's say supply goes up so we're gonna say up arrow with an S so an increase in supply well here's the supply curve increase when something increases on a on a graph that means it moves to the right and so we're gonna draw some right arrows or draw a right arrow there and a right arrow there so we're gonna say an increase in supply results in a right shift of the s-curve right supply curve shift over to the right so we're gonna draw a new supply curve over to the right it's gonna look like this and put s Prime for the new supply curve now here's what you're gonna this could mix you up so be careful with this some people the way they look at this new curve is they look at it as being below the original supply curve so they think a decrease in supply but you can't think up and down you have to think right and left yes it looks like this curve is below this curve but that's not what happened what happened is the curve increase it moved over to the right so now this is an this represents what you're looking at right here represents an increase in supply and our new intersection point our new equilibrium point is right there and now if we draw over to the price axis what do we see what just happened to equilibrium price it went down so we'll have PE prime that's a decrease in equilibrium price if we go over here to the intersection and go down to the quantity axis what happened to equilibrium quantity will equilibrium quantity increased QE Prime and so the net result is when there is an increase in supply in a market the result on price and quantity will be there will be a decrease in equilibrium price and an increase in equilibrium quantity because of the market forces because the suppliers and demanders are always trying to get back to equilibrium they are agreeing to get back to equilibrium so when this supply curve shifts that equilibrium point is going to move with the shift ultimately resulting in a decrease in equilibrium price and an increase in equilibrium quantity so we're gonna write that down an increase in supply is going to result in a decrease in equilibrium price so we're gonna put a down arrow with a PE but an increase in equilibrium quantity so that's an up arrow with a q sub e well does that make sense well let's think about this if suppliers if a seller is able to produce and sell more there's a specific reason that that happens all of a sudden let's say after something happens out there in the world now they're like hey we can make more stuff when they can make more stuff what that means is their quantity will go up and because they can make more stuff they can actually charge a lower price well let's explain why they can charge a lower price in a later lesson but understand that when supply increase the price will go down in the in that particular market while the quantity goes up and doesn't that sound awesome lower price more stuff yes this has happened with lots of things in the world there are lots of things where let's say 30 years ago we couldn't get as much of it and it was super expensive for example cell phones it used to be gosh to have a cell phone like only maybe one in every 10 or 20,000 people probably had a cell phone they hit they came in you had to carry around a battery a giant battery in a bag and the phone had a wire that attached to the battery and they were just really heavy and clunky they were way more expensive than what we currently pay for our cell phone service and our phones can do more nowadays than those phones used to be able to do a long time ago they were extremely expensive high in price low in quantity but because the productivity because the supply of mobile phones has increased now everybody has one some people have two three or more of them right because the supply of mobile phones has increased suppliers have been able to make more why because of technology we've been able to develop technology that ultimately brings down the price so that more people can buy them and increases the quantity so that more people can have them and have more than one of them okay all right last one decrease in supply a decrease in supply that's going to be a downward arrow with an S that's gonna be a decrease means left right so because the numbers getting smaller smaller numbers are to the left so that's a left shift of the supply curve so we're gonna say left supply curve shift okay let's go ahead and draw that in here supply curve shifts to the left shifts the left arrows right so our new supply curve is over here to the left so we're gonna put s Prime and now our new intersection point our new equilibrium point is right here intersects we're gonna draw over to the price axis this way what happened to the price well it was here now it's up here so we have an increase in equilibrium price it's PE Prime and on quantity let's draw a dash line down to the quantity axis oh look at that quantity has decreased q e Prime and here's what I'm saying is that in a market when supply in that market decreases they're producing less of it they are less able or less willing to produce and when they are less able and less willing to produce in that market the supply curve shifts to the left the price tends to go up and the quantity produced and bought tends to go down so a decrease in supply is going to result in an increase in equilibrium price that's piece of e it's gonna increase with the up arrow and it's going to result in a decrease in equilibrium quantity that's a deep that's a down arrow with a QE okay that's it these are the four possible changes that could happen in any product market and this summarizes the result in each one of those four changes of what ultimately will happen to equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity and you don't have to memorize this chart all you have to do is know how to use this graph start off with a supply and demand curve know where the intersection is move one of the four curves either right or left and then see where the where the new intersection point is and what that does to equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity and now you can answer any question okay and that's it for market dynamics",
                "summary": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okNiow7QCTg : alright folks in this lesson what we're now gonna move on to is what I call market dynamics now what we have here is a basic market graph for a product ok now we do not care what the product is but what we're we can we can pretend or imagine all different kinds of products it can be a good what we call a physical good it

equilibrium price and if the equilibrium point wound up being down here somewhere or over here so anywhere below this anywhere down here we would have a decrease equilibrium price would go down and we would say down arrow piece of e that's a decrease in equilibrium price okay so what we said in a previous lesson is this is that the supply and demand curve they can shift and and when the supply or the demand curve shift on the market graph they only go left and right they never go up and down now that should already be in your notes okay and what we said is that a left shift this direction is

curve would move to the right or this whole curve would move to the right okay right shift is considered to be an increase in supply or an increase in demand okay do you remember at the very beginning of the class we talked about ceteris paribus the ceteris paribus assumption and what we said was this is that this ceteris paribus is where we hold everything unchanged except for one thing we're only going to change one thing at a time and then see how that changes other things what are the effects of making just a single change and so here's what I want to show you the first thing I want to say is that that these changes down here changes in equilibrium price and changes in equilibrium quantity those are results those aren't things that we're going to change okay those are the results of change they are not we're not making those things happen that's what's happening as a result of something changing but change in demand and change in supply those are the things that we're going to change okay we will change these okay so we're going to we are going to cause them to change so we're gonna cut this is the cause and this down here is the effect so we have because and the effect these are the results of the change so here's the kinds of questions I'm going to ask I'm going to say when there is an increase in demand and what then will happen to equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity what will be the resulting change in equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity when there is an increase in demand and so what we're now going to do is one thing at a time we're gonna look at these four changes there's four possible changes because there's two things that we're changing we're changing demand and we're changing supply and when we change them they can only either increase or decrease so two things can change in two ways so that's four possible changes in any market and we're gonna look one at a time at all four of those changes and how each one of those four changes is going to affect the results of equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity and when each one of when supply or demand change in a market we call that a dynamic market the market is dynamic the supply curve is moving fluctuating the demand curve is moving it is fluctuating and when the supply curve fluctuates and when the demand curve fluctuates it results in fluctuations in price and quantity and that's what we're gonna see right now all right so what I've done here is I've set up in two different ways over here we're going to create a chart and over here we're going to look at the graphs so what we're gonna do is we're gonna work from here take our information from the graph and we're gonna put it over here in the chart so that you can summarize the information about what happens when there is an increase or a decrease in demand or supply okay and since there's four possible changes what I thought that we could do is we could we would have a separate graph for each one of the changes so let's go ahead and start up here but now note that all four of these graphs are the starting position of the market let's say that we have a market that it that hasn't changed in just a little while that the supply and the demand curve are just sort of sitting there demanders this is how they feel suppliers this is their cost structure and because of the cost structure of the suppliers and the attitudes of the demanders the this is the equilibrium price at the intersection and this is the equilibrium quantity from the intersection and it's the same in all four of these cases now what we're going to do is we're gonna make a different change in each one of these in this graph we're gonna do an increase in demand in this graph we're gonna do an increase in supply in this graph we're gonna do a decrease in demand and in this graph we're gonna do a decrease in supply now in in the next lesson I'm gonna explain to you why these things change why does the demand curve change why does the supply curve change but for now I don't want I don't want to talk about that let's just assume that something is happening that it's causing the demand curve or the supply curve to change okay now when the curve or when demand changes the way it's gonna look is as a shift in the curve and we talked about that in a previous lesson and what we said just a little while ago is that when there is an increase in demand demand increasing an increase means a rightward movement an increase is going to the right because remember we said that these curves they don't go up and down they go left and right okay so an increase mathematically means to the right all the larger numbers are to the right and all the smaller numbers are to the left so an increase in demand which I'm going to represent as an upward arrow with a an upward arrow with a D so an increase in demand and then what I often do is I put these sideways arrows my sideways arrows basically means leads to okay so or causes so an increase in demand is going to cause like a domino effect a chain reaction an increase in demand causes a rightward shift of the demand curve so to the right I'm going to put a couple rightward arrows there's a right arrow there's another right arrow pointing to the right indicating an increase and this curve is going to sort of move along those arrows and move over to the right and so now we're gonna have a new demand curve the demand curve is shifting over to the right and I'm gonna represent that by the letter D with a little apostrophe on it and we call that D Prime and so if there is an increase in demand that's gonna be represented on a market graph as a rightward shift of the demand curve over to D Prime and now look what happened let's ignore this intersection here this intersection is going away this is no longer the equilibrium the new equilibrium is where the old supply curve which didn't move ceteris paribus we're only moving one thing at a time the new demand curve is over here and look this point right here that's the new intersection of supply and demand this one is gone market forces are now going to get involved see now the price is too low and what's gonna happen here if we go if we then take this equilibrium point and go over here to the left that's gonna be our new equilibrium remember market forces say if the price is too low here if demand has increased that's gonna put upward force on the price and when the price goes up so we're gonna have PE prime that's the new equilibrium and we can go vertically down here to the quantity axis and that is our new equilibrium quantity will put Queen Q to the QE Prime and look what happened to equilibrium quantity is it it also increased and here's what I'm trying to show you here is the result is that when demand increases that results in a right shift a right D demand curve shift okay so a rightward shift of the demand curve and then it's going to result in two things first of all it's going to result in an increase in equilibrium price so increase in P sub e which we could represent as up arrow an up arrow P sub e right it's also going to result in an increase in equilibrium quantity so increase in Q sub e and in parentheses we'll say that that's an up arrow with a q sub e so here's what I'm saying is that when there's an increase in demand in any market there will subsequently be an increase in equilibrium price and an increase in equilibrium quantity okay so let's think about what does this mean let's get away from the math and the graph so let's think about this let's say that there's a particular pair of shoes that becomes more popular I brought this up previously let's say that there was an athlete that won a big event at the Olympics and now all of a sudden everybody wants the same shoes that that athlete was wearing well the demand for that shoe is going to increase more people are going to be more willing and more able to buy those shoes mostly willing they'll be more willing to buy the shoes when those people are more willing to buy those shoes you know what's gonna happen to that shoe the price is gonna go up but people are still gonna buy more of it even though the price goes up people are gonna buy more why are they buying more even though the price went up you're gonna say professor Ryan you said that when the price goes up people are gonna buy less yes that's ceteris paribus that's with no change in demand but now something has caused people to want that product more they are more willing than they used to be so their demand changed when the demand changes in an increased direction the net result according to this graph is that the price will go up and there will be more produced and more sold doesn't that make sense when something's more popular when something becomes more popular they're willing to it always winds up going up in price and people wind up buying more and more of it that's weird yes that's because the demand curve shifted to the right okay all right that's an increase in demand well now let's do a decrease in demand what would happen if demand decreased what if people wanted less of something they were less willing or less able to buy it let's say that they were less able to let's say people have less money something happens and people just have less money than they used to have okay just maybe for a little a little while all of a sudden people can't buy all the same things they were buying before okay let's say that they were able to buy I don't know let's think of something good they were able to go out to eat a lot but now that they have less money they can't go out to eat a lot okay so let's say that this is the supply and the demand for eating out at restaurants okay well people are going to eat out at restaurants less there's going to be a decrease in demand well a decrease remember we said it only either moves right or left decrease for something to become smaller is indicated by a leftward movement and so a decrease in demand so put downward arrow with a D is going to lead to a left demand curve shift so a leftward shift of the demand curve and a leftward shift so we're going to put some left arrows in here go ahead and put a left arrow a left arrow so now that demand curve is going to move over to the left so I'm going to draw a demand curve over to the left that's our new demand curve which we're gonna call D Prime that's our new demand curve and now look at the new intersection point here's the equilibrium point the equilibrium point used to be up here but now the equilibrium point is down here and if we draw a little dashed line over here and we draw a little dashed line down here to the quantity we can see that the new equilibrium price which we'll call equal of PE prime + QE prime that is the new equilibrium price in the new equilibrium quantity and you can see here now that there is a dots indicating what happened to the price the price went from up here down to here and the quantity went from here over to here backwards to the left so that's a decrease in equilibrium quantity and a decrease in equilibrium price so here's what we're gonna say look when there's a decrease in demand not only will there be a leftward shift of the demand curve but we will ultimately the result will be that there will be a decrease in equilibrium price which we'll put as a downward arrow with a piece of e there will also be a decrease in equilibrium quantity so we'll put downward arrow with a Q sub E now if you're catching on to this then these last two supply they're going to be a piece of cake well you have to be good at doing is you have to be good at producing one of these starting graphs and then deciding for yourself what's moving is the demand curve moving or is the supply curve moving and so now we're going to work on an increase in supply so let's say supply goes up so we're gonna say up arrow with an S so an increase in supply well here's the supply curve increase when something increases on a on a graph that means it moves to the right and so we're gonna draw some right arrows or draw a right arrow there and a right arrow there so we're gonna say an increase in supply results in a right shift of the s-curve right supply curve shift over to the right so we're gonna draw a new supply curve over to the right it's gonna look like this and put s Prime for the new supply curve now here's what you're gonna this could mix you up so be careful with this some people the way they look at this new curve is they look at it as being below the original supply curve so they think a decrease in supply but you can't think up and down you have to think right and left yes it looks like this curve is below this curve but that's not what happened what happened is the curve increase it moved over to the right so now this is an this represents what you're looking at right here represents an increase in supply and our new intersection point our new equilibrium point is right there and now if we draw over to the price axis what do we see what just happened to equilibrium price it went down so we'll have PE prime that's a decrease in equilibrium price if we go over here to the intersection and go down to the quantity axis what happened to equilibrium quantity will equilibrium quantity increased QE Prime and so the net result is when there is an increase in supply in a market the result on price and quantity will be there will be a decrease in equilibrium price and an increase in equilibrium quantity because of the market forces because the suppliers and demanders are always trying to get back to equilibrium they are agreeing to get back to equilibrium so when this supply curve shifts that equilibrium point is going to move with the shift ultimately resulting in a decrease in equilibrium price and an increase in equilibrium quantity so we're gonna write that down an increase in supply is going to result in a decrease in equilibrium price so we're gonna put a down arrow with a PE but an increase in equilibrium quantity so that's an up arrow with a q sub e well does that make sense well let's think about this if suppliers if a seller is able to produce and sell more there's a specific reason that that happens all of a sudden let's say after something happens out there in the world now they're like hey we can make more stuff when they can make more stuff what that means is their quantity will go up and because they can make more stuff they can actually charge a lower price well let's explain why they can charge a lower price in a later lesson but understand that when supply increase the price will go down in the in that particular market while the quantity goes up and doesn't that sound awesome lower price more stuff yes this has happened with lots of things in the world there are lots of things where let's say 30 years ago we couldn't get as much of it and it was super expensive for example cell phones it used to be gosh to have a cell phone like only maybe one in every 10 or 20,000 people probably had a cell phone they hit they came in you had to carry around a battery a giant battery in a bag and the phone had a wire that attached to the battery and they were just really heavy and clunky they were way more expensive than what we currently pay for our cell phone service and our phones can do more nowadays than those phones used to be able to do a long time ago they were extremely expensive high in price low in quantity but because the productivity because the supply of mobile phones has increased now everybody has one some people have two three or more of them right because the supply of mobile phones has increased suppliers have been able to make more why because of technology we've been able to develop technology that ultimately brings down the price so that more people can buy them and increases the quantity so that more people can have them and have more than one of them okay all right last one decrease in supply a decrease in supply that's going to be a downward arrow with an S that's gonna be a decrease means left right so because the numbers getting smaller smaller numbers are to the left so that's a left shift of the supply curve so we're gonna say left supply curve shift okay let's go ahead and draw that in here supply curve shifts to the left shifts the left arrows right so our new supply curve is over here to the left so we're gonna put s Prime and now our new intersection point our new equilibrium point is right here intersects we're gonna draw over to the price axis this way what happened to the price well it was here now it's up here so we have an increase in equilibrium price it's PE Prime and on quantity let's draw a dash line down to the quantity axis oh look at that quantity has decreased q e Prime and here's what I'm saying is that in a market when supply in that market decreases they're producing less of it they are less able or less willing to produce and when they are less able and less willing to produce in that market the supply curve shifts to the left the price tends to go up and the quantity produced and bought tends to go down so a decrease in supply is going to result in an increase in equilibrium price that's piece of e it's gonna increase with the up arrow and it's going to result in a decrease in equilibrium quantity that's a deep that's a down arrow with a QE okay that's it these are the four possible changes that could happen in any product market and this summarizes the result in each one of those four changes of what ultimately will happen to equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity and you don't have to memorize this chart all you have to do is know how to use this graph start off with a supply and demand curve know where the intersection is move one of the four curves either right or left and then see where the where the new intersection point is and what that does to equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity and now you can answer any question okay and that's it for market dynamics"
