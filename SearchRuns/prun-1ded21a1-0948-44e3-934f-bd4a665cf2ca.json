They excel in solving problems like factoring large numbers and simulating quantum systems, which are infeasible for classical systems. However, their speed advantage is task-dependent and not universal. Current quantum computers are still in developmental stages, with limited qubit coherence and error rates, but they hold promise for future breakthroughs."
