They are typically knitted or crocheted from wool, cotton, or synthetic fibers, providing warmth and comfort in cooler climates. The design of jumpers can vary widely, including crew necks, V-necks, turtlenecks, and cardigans, each offering different styles and levels of warmth. Historically, jumpers have been a staple in fashion, evolving from practical workwear to high-fashion items. They are often associated with cultural and regional identities, such as the iconic Aran sweater from Ireland, known for its intricate cable patterns. In contemporary fashion, jumpers are celebrated for their adaptability, being worn casually or dressed up for more formal occasions. The sustainability of materials used in jumpers is increasingly important, with a growing emphasis on eco-friendly and ethically sourced fibers.",
