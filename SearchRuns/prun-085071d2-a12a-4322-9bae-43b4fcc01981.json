                "value": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMW0pAgs82Q : chat GPT just released one of its most important updates of all time The ability to reference all your previous chat So it could give you personalized responses This is a whole new way that is going to give chat GPT memory and make it a whole lot more practical Okay I'm going to show you exactly how this works with some prompts that you could use for yourself too But the biggest benefit here is because it could have reference to all your old chats on top of the old memory that it used to have which I'll show you that too You have more controls there You don't need to repeat yourself as much The previous memory was very limited And now this is a whole different way kind of an infinite way to reference the old chats based on your old chat history Now as I'm recording this video this option got released in my Pro and Plus account but it's not inside of the Chat GPD teams account which I actually use more often That's going to take another couple of weeks it looks like And hopefully at some point it comes to the free accounts I'm sure they will have some version of it in the free account But to get started here I'm just going to say what do you remember about me and then I'll show you the old memory versus the new one and how it combines the two because there is a whole new thing called reference memory Now now this is the best way to get started what do you remember about me and then read through what it remembers about you And if it gets something wrong just simply say forget this part of it Okay right here it remembered something about my target audience for skill And this is kind of not true So I'm going to say forget this And you could ask it to forget anything that it remembers about you So it cleans up its own memory There's another function inside of the settings that I'll show you here in a second If you go to the settings menu right here Now if you go to the personalization tab here under memory you'll see two different sections So reference saved memory This is kind of the old memory that it used to have Mine was constantly full That's when you chat with chat GPT It would on its own choose to remember something about you or you could say remember this about me and then the memory would get full and then you would have to manage the memory which I'll show you that too And this still has limitation on how much it could save Reference chat history This is kind of the big thing right now Let's chat reference all your previous conversations when responding and there is no limit to this This is not really like a notepad with a limitation in the context that it will store This is incredible right here So both of them are turned on by default as soon as I got access And there's an FAQ page here And there's some things that I want to point out in a second but I want to start with a couple of different prompts so you see it in action under manage memory If you go to this tab right here now here's the saved memory option And we've had this for quite a while where you could delete all saved memories or just press the trash can to delete any individual memory and you could ask chat GPT to remember something specifically about you And as long as you had space it would save it here But a lot of times it saves things that kind of don't make sense Request a compilation brain teaser puzzle to solve once a week in the evening Well I don't really need it to remember that about me so I'm gonna go ahead and forget that Right so you could do that inside of chat You could do that here So that is the old reference saved memories that we still have Now this one is still very useful I asked chat GPT to remember things about me but you do have to manually manage it all the time Mine gets full all the time inside of my regular teams account here But this one is what I'm really excited about Let me show you some prompting now Now this is the prompt that chat GPT gives you that is also a good starter prompt Describe me based on all our chats So now it's using the reference the chat memory instead of that other memory So there's two different things to kind of keep track of And I said make it catchy You're sharp no fluff founder with an camera eye and growth brain You run Skillip AI like a boss merging education with strategy Okay It's definitely being very nice to me So you could start with something like this just to see how it remembers you based on your previous conversations And you could also do things like this So it stores it to memory So you don't have to repeat yourself So for example remember my core product pitch for skill leap So I don't have to rewrite it every single time This way every time I mention skill leap it just knows what it is I don't have to anytime I want to do any email marketing any ad copy any website improvement I don't have to do that It says \"Got it Paste it here.\" Now I'm going to turn on search I'm going to say \"What is Skill Leap AI?\" It'll just go do a web search here and it'll pull in the information for me I literally don't even have to type it on my own Okay perfect Online learning education It pulled it from my website from LinkedIn Okay I'm gonna ask it to turn this into my core product pitch Now it has the core product pitch It's asking me if I want to make it punchier or more technical because I didn't give it any kind of reference for style But I think this is fine Now I'm going to tell it to remember this as my core product pitch And it will save it here to its memory Saved You won't have to rewrite it again Just ask if you ever need it Okay So this is a great great timesaver And this is now in addition to referencing your old chats So if I go to the manage section here this is where it saves that type of memory where you do these kind of prompts Referencing your old chat just happens by default You don't have to do anything So that is a huge improvement from how chat GPT used to work with We only had access to this save memory function Now here's another example I'm going to ask you to track my marketing experiments I do a lot of marketing experience week to week so we could review it and then improve upon it So I'm going to ask it to save that That's going to save it to our memory here too Now let me show you a little bit more detail about how memory works inside of chat GPT So the reference saved memories These are the ones where you ask chat GPT to remember like your name favorite colors some of the things I showed you so far And then there is reference chat history which is the big improvement I'm really excited about Chat GPT can also use information from your past chats and make future conversations more helpful For example if you once said \"I like Thai food.\" Then it may take that into account the next time you ask it \"What should I have for lunch?\" Now the nice thing is they have independent control in the settings that I showed you So you could turn both of them on or off or just one of them on or off And right here how long does chat GPT keep save memories so that notepad that I showed you with your save memories are stored separately from your chat history So they're two separate things That means even if you delete a chat your saved memories from that can still be used The saved memories are the ones with a trash can next to each one You could also ask chatpt to forget a saved memory which I showed you And then there is this whole other way right saved memories can also show up from past conversations If you want to delete references to those things that's not stored in the memory section You will have to clear that by deleting that individual previous chat history So you could use the search box inside of chat GPD find that chat and just delete that chat history So for example if I wanted to delete this one this Ray-B band ad that I created here with the image gen I could just go ahead and press these three dots and delete it and it won't remember anything from our previous conversation about this So it won't be able to pull that in in any future conversation Now here's another thing to keep in mind about reference chat history Unlike saved memories which are kept until you delete them details from past chats can change over time as chat GPT updates What's more helpful to remember because chat GPT doesn't retain every detail from past chats use save memory for anything you wanted to always remember Now does chat have a storage limit when it comes to reference chat history no there is no limitation on reference chat history As long as that option is turned on in the settings it will do its best all the time When a old chat comes in handy in a new conversation it will just have that context about you So a lot of things like custom instructions are not going to be as relevant anymore right a lot of the prompting techniques where you give the prompt a lot of information might not be as needed Now now relating to privacy here does memory remember sensitive information a lot of times a lot of people use chat GPT like a therapist maybe those are things you don't want it to remember about you Memories raise important privacy and safety considerations especially around what type of information should be remembered on how that information is used But ultimately it says if memory is enabled please avoid entering information you wouldn't want remembered But for that we always have this option by the way on top for temporary chats When you use this option it's not in the history it doesn't train the model and the memory is turned off So this is a great way if you just want a quick chat that you don't want remembered that you don't want to taint the history or you don't want to taint the memory just use this and then go back to your regular chat GPT by just pressing this new one and it will take you out of temporary mode And here's a prompt I really like Based on everything you remember about me give me the list of 10 things I should store to saved memory So this is going to look into past conversations This is going to look into current saved memory It's going to look into both of those and it's going to give me some information here So you're a founder focused on growing a platform on boarding instructors and testing marketing strategy So if you think this is useful you could store this to memory and go down this list Anything that you think is relevant store to memory Anything that is not relevant you could skip or just ask it to forget something that is already stored in memory just using the chat down here And next week I'm releasing a brand new chat GPT and prompting course for 2025 So if you're a beginner to chat GPT or if you're not getting the most out of it this is a very beginnerfriendly course It's going to be about 20 videos And when it comes to the essential parts of using Chat GPT this should get you started And we just rolled out a 7-day free trial which gives you access to this course right here as soon as it comes out And it gives you access to all our courses for the same free trial and monthly subscription And we just rolled out some new courses that's really popular This one AI powered presentation is doing really well And this one this notebook LM course I released a couple months ago This is 34 lessons and this is all about one of my favorite AI apps of all time called Notebook LM And in the last few weeks there's been ton of new updates in the world of AI So I made a video covering the top 10 updates that got released into the top 10 AI apps So I'll link that video here Thanks for watching I'll see you next time",
