meta and someone suggested tobacco as kind of the guideline that you might want to follow some dangerous product that was lessened in intensity to the public by misrepresentations Uh as I mentioned at the outset I was part of the effort to bring them down Didn't realize I'd reached a tipping point with smoking on airplanes but it turned out to be one Uh and things changed You make a reference uh as well in the book that a lot of the executives at Facebook protected their own children from what might have been an exploitation what you've described here the algorithm that analyzes your activity on on the board and says \"Well just deleted a selfie Good time for an ad.\" Somebody had put that together So these executives at Facebook protected their own kids from that kind of exploitation Correct Senator That that was one of the things that shocked me when I moved to Silicon Valley is that it's a place full of you know wooden Monttoauri to toys and you know executives would always speak about how they have screens in the house or you know they I would say you know oh has your teen use the new product we're allow about to launch and they're like I my teenager is not allowed on Facebook I don't have my teenager on Instagram like the these executives they know they know the harm that this product does They don't allow their own teenagers to use the products that Meta develops I mean it's the hypocrisy is at every level So I wanted to just tell you a follow-up to that story Eventually the children of tobacco executives became my greatest fans and supporters And they would basically shame their parents by saying that you know the kids at school are saying this or I just heard something or I read something Dad tell me that you aren't part of that tobacco conspiracy to keep the truth from the American people They became a force a moral force in the conversation Uh I it just be speculation but I hope that uh that is the case here as well I hope you're right Senator I read these things and and so I want to ask you a question that is more generic but I'm just curious as to the decision process at the highest levels when there is a decision being made about what you're going to turn over what Facebook Meta is going to turn over to the Chinese all their demands that you said the company denied to so many other countries but for China they made an exception when the decision is being made about exposing American privacy material and data so that the Chinese would have access to it Americans not knowing that the security questions that that you raised the AI information is given to the Chinese that makes them quote more competitive but also means that they have sources of information that could compromise the security of the United States I mean when you consider each one of these they kind of grow in gravity and magnitude Are these decisions being made strictly by Zuckerberg himself or by boards or by open discussion how much sensitivity was there to the fact that the decisions were historic in nature and maybe even criminal it's a really interesting question Um I mean you asked me in part about China uh you know to to give you just one example um the at the governance level which is what you're asking me uh the lead independent director on Meta's board uh was also on the payroll for the China project so that they had dual loyalty I think the question around accountability and governance of this company and of tech companies more generally There needs to be a lot more accountability I don't think the current governance structures are anywhere close to being sufficient Tell me that there were people at that company that you worked with that didn't sell out AB: Absolutely Absolutely Listen there are you know there were amazing amazing people and there were people who were horrified and had very strong moral conscience Um and there are there are many of these people who've been in touch who since the books since these revelations have come out who said you know I was in those meetings I remember this You know there were people who spoke up There were people um I regret to say that many of the people who spoke up are no longer at the company but there there are good people there and there are people who have moral beliefs and and there certainly were but that wasn't happening at the top of the company that wasn't happening at the executive level and what was striking was the absence of those types of discussions at the top of the company compared to what was happening with your average people who are working at the company And you say Mr Zuckerberg himself prides himself on being a loyal American I think Mr Zuckerberg would say he does Yes But I don't want to speak for him No of course not But I think the evidence that you've given us points in the other direction Lying to Congress may be in the realm of a mortal sin depending on your faith conviction but uh certainly selling out the security and privacy of the United States is about as low as they go when it comes to big tech Have you been any conversations uh involving section 230 no No Senator All right Well that's that's certainly a law that we're taking a close look at here which shields companies like this from personal civil liability Many of us believe the committee has voted accordingly that if they would could be held accountable for their decisions in a court of law and find damages money to money that this would have more impact than some of the best speeches we could put together as members of Congress So we're going to work on that Mr Chairman I thank you for this hearing but I particularly thank you because you've referred to in your testimony what you call in the book three pistols which I think is your reference to the three children You've done a great thing for them and for kids all across the the world Thank you for testifying today Thank you Senator",
