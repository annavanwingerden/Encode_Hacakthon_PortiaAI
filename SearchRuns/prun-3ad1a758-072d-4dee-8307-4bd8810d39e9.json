Quantum computers leverage qubits and principles of superposition and entanglement to perform complex calculations at speeds unattainable by classical systems for specific problems, such as factoring large numbers and simulating quantum systems. Notably, Google's Sycamore processor achieved quantum supremacy in 2019 by solving a problem in 200 seconds that would take the fastest classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years. However, practical, large-scale quantum computing remains in development, with challenges in error rates and qubit coherence still being addressed. As research progresses, quantum computers are expected to revolutionize fields like cryptography, optimization, and materials science.",
