That's because AIs aren't\nprogrammed, but trained. And during training, they learn their own\nstrategies to solve problems. If we want AIs to be as useful, reliable, and secure as possible, we\nwant to open up the black box and understand why they do things. But even opening the black\nbox isn't very helpful because we don't know how\nto interpret what we see. Think of it like a neuroscientist\ninvestigating the brain. We need tools to work out\nwhat's going on inside. We want to know how the model\nconnects all the concepts in its mind and uses them\nto answer our questions. Now we've developed ways to observe some of an AI model's internal\nthought processes. We can actually see how\nthese concepts are connected to form logical circuits. Let's take a simple example\nwhere we asked Claude to write the second line of a poem. The poem starts, \"He saw a\ncarrot and had to grab it.\" In our study, we found that\nClaude is planning a rhyme even before writing the\nbeginning of the line. Claude sees \"a carrot\" and \"grab it\" and thinks of \"rabbit\" as a\nword that would make sense with carrot and rhyme with grab it. Then it writes the rest of the line. \"His hunger was like a starving rabbit.\" We look at the place that the model was thinking\nabout the word rabbit, and we see other ideas it had\nfor places to take the poem. We also see the word\nhabit is present there. Our new methods allow us to go in and intervene on this circuit. In this case, we dampen down rabbit, as the model is planning\nthe second line of the poem, and then ask Claude to\ncomplete the line again. \"His hunger was a powerful habit.\" We see that the model is\ncapable of taking the beginning of a new poem and thinking of different ways it could complete it, and then writing it\ntowards those completions. The fact we can cause\nthese changes to occur well before the final line is\nwritten is strong evidence that the model is planning ahead of time. This poetry planning result, along with the many other\nexamples in our paper, only makes sense in a world where the models are really\nthinking, in their own way, about what they say. Just as neuroscience\nhelps us treat diseases and make people healthier, our longer-term plan is to\nuse this deeper understanding of AI to help make the models\nsafer and more reliable. If we can learn to read the model's mind, we can be much more confident\nit is doing what we intended. You can find many more examples of Claude's internal\nthoughts in our new paper at anthropic.com/research.",
