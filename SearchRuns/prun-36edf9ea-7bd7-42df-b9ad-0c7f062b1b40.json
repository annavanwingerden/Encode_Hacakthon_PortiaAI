The manufacturing process involves three main steps: the fusion of raw materials, working with the molten mass, and annealing. Key raw materials include soda ash (Na2CO3), limestone (CaCO3), and sand (SiO2), which are mixed with cullet to lower the melting temperature. The mixture is heated to 1,000°C, resulting in a liquid glass from which impurities are removed. The molten glass is then shaped in molds and undergoes annealing, a process of controlled cooling that strengthens the glass. Various types of glass, such as soda glass, Pyrex, quartz, flint, and borosilicate, are discussed, each with distinct properties and applications ranging from window panes and laboratory glassware to optical instruments and baking dishes.",

Key materials like soda ash, limestone, and sand are mixed with cullet, heated to 1,000°C, and impurities are removed. The molten glass is molded and annealed for strength. Types of glass such as soda, Pyrex, quartz, flint, and borosilicate are explored, highlighting their properties and uses.
